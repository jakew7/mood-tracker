      <p>It started out as an idea where anyone could take notes of their daily mood and track them. Giving them a better understanding of their feelings, why they feel a certain way, and what can they do to increase and decrease the things that give them stress, sadness, happiness, love, and more.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This web application makes it possible for this idea to become possible. I hope that it can help you create a better mental on your journey.</p>
